<h1>Examples</h1>

<p>Clarion is designed to fit comfortably into your framework of choice. Whether you are using server-side rendering for your pages or a single-page application, there should be no trouble implementing the Clarion Style Architecture into your project. Many of the frameworks out there already have the tooling in place and all you need to do is add the Clarion Style Architecture in order to start taking advantage of its benefits.</p>
