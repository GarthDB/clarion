---

<h1>Clarion and ASP.Net</h1>

<p>Clarion fits in nicely with your ASP.Net projects. Managing Font, Style and Script files in your presentation layer can often
    become complex and cluttered very quickly. Clarion will help keep your project clean.</p>

<h2>Add the Architecture</h2>
<p>In the command line, navigate to to the project folder you would like to add Clarion to. (If you are using Visual Studio
    2017, you right-click the project and select "Open in Command Line".)</p>
<p>Run the following command to install the basic architecture:</p>
<p><code>clarion new</code></p>

<h2>Include New Files</h2>
<p>The first thing that needs to be done is to include the new files and folders in the project.</p>
<ol>
    <li>At the top of the Solution Explorer window select the "Show All Files" button.</li>
    <li>Right-click the following directories and files and select "Include In Project":
        <ul>
            <li><code>build</code></li>
            <li><code>src</code></li>
            <li><code>package.json</code></li>
            <li><code>postcss.config.js</code></li>
            <li><code>webpack.config.js</code></li>
        </ul>
    </li>
    <li>You can delete the index.html file.</li>
</ol>

<h2>Update Directories</h2>
<p>Now that the files have been added to the project, there are 2 things that need to be updated:</p>
<ol>
    <li>The added directories probably do not match the project's naming conventions.</li>
    <li>Files added using the CLI will not be included in the project and will have to be included manually.</li>
</ol>
