<h1>Configuration</h1>

<p>In order to fit your development environment's needs, Clarion is configurable. If the default configuration is used, no config
    file is generated in order to avoid unnecessary clutter in your project. To add a config file to your project, run the
    following command at the root of your project:</p>
<code>clarion config init</code><br><br>
<p>You should now see a new file called <code>.clarion</code> in your project. The file contains a simple JSON object.</p>
{% highlight javascript %}
    {
        "paths": {
            "styles": "./src",
            "scripts": "./src"
        },
        "format": {
            "styles": "scss",
            "scripts": "js"
        },
        "addToManifest": "true",
        "importAbstracts": "true"
    }
{% endhighlight %}
<p>You can modify this content directly using your text editor, but you can also use the Clarion CLI to make changes.</p>

<h2>Paths</h2>
<p>You can change the location of your project contents. This is extremely useful if you are using a framework or have a specific
    architecture you need to adhere to.</p>
<p>For example, if I wanted to move my styles folder to a directory called "app" rather than "src" I could do so using the following
    command <strong>(Note: Clarion will look for your styles in directories called <code>sass</code>, <code>scss</code>, or <code>less</code>)</strong>:</p>
<code>clarion config paths.styles app</code><br><br>

<h2>Format</h2>
<p>You can change the file format. This will not change the existing files, but will take effect for new files.</p>
<code>clarion config format.styles less</code><br><br>
<p>Any new files will now use the <code>.less</code> style format.</p>

<h2>Add To Manifest</h2>
<p>If you would like to turn off the feature of automatically adding an import statement for new files to your manifest file,
    you can turn it off using the following command:</p>
<code>clarion config addToManifest false</code><br><br>
<p>You can turn it back on again by setting the value to <code>true</code>.</p>

<h2>Import Abstracts</h2>
<p>When a new style file is created, the Abstracts manifest file is imported to give you access to your variables, mixins, etc.
    Some developers may want to be more selective about the files they would like to import. You can prevent Clarion from
    adding this reference using the following command:</p>
<code>clarion config importAbstracts false</code><br><br>
<p>You can turn it back on again by setting the value to <code>true</code>.</p>
