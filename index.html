<h3>Your New Project</h3>
<p>The default project is configured with <a href="http://sass-lang.com/">SASS</a> using the .scss syntax and <a href="https://webpack.js.org/">webpack</a> as the compiler and module manager.</p>
<p>The project architecture implements the Clarion Style Architecture.</p>

<h2>Adding a New File</h2>
<p>Additional style files can easily be manged through the CLI as well. In your terminal type the following command:</p>
<code>
    clarion add element headings
</code>
<br><br>
<p>This will create the file <code>_headings.scss</code> in the <code>03_Elements</code> directory as well as add <code>@import '_headings.scss';</code> import statement to the directory manifest file so it can be included in your final CSS file.</p>

<h2>Removing a File</h2>
<p>Similar to adding a file, removing files can also be done through the CLI.</p>
<code>
    clarion remove element headings
</code>
<br><br>
<p>This will remove the file <code>_headings.scss</code> in the <code>03_Elements</code> directory as well as remove <code>@import '_headings.scss';</code> import statement from the directory manifest file.</p>

<h2>Building Your Project for Production</h2>
<p>To build your application for final use, run the build command.</p>
<code>
    npm run build
</code>
<br><br>
<p>The final compiled JavaScript and CSS file are in <code>build</code> directory in the root of your project.</p>
